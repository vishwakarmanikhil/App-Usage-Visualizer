# App Usage Visualizer with React

Welcome to the App Usage Visualizer, a dynamic React application that provides an intuitive representation of app usage patterns throughout a 24-hour period. The app utilizes JSON data to visualize on and off times for multiple applications, presenting the information in an interactive donut graph. Users can easily switch between different apps using a dropdown menu, gaining valuable insights into their usage over time.
